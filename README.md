# college-voting-system
This project is to provide an online platform for colleges/institutions to conduct elections. The Colleges can create an account,verify themselves
and create polls and candidates.
The College is considered as the user and they can login after authenticating themselves using a valid Mail and they can start creating polls
and candidates. They can even delete the students/poll if they commit mistake.
After their creation they can commit their changes and conduct election on the required date and time. For verifying the appropriate voters
the college needs to upload a database of valid students with their mobile number. 
The format should of the .csv file should be as follows:
Field #1:   Register Number
Field #2:   Mobile Number
After the election is posted the students can go on to vote and they have to give their valid register number and in turn to verify them 
they have to enter the OTP that they receive to their number.
The result can be viewed after the result time given by the college. After this election the college can also clear everything by resetting 
everything back to default.
